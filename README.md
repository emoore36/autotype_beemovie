# autotype_beemovie
A Python project that reads the bee movie script out to where I tell it to (my notepad and some Discord servers).


Understand that this will not work unless you tweak it to do what you want it to do. I told it what to open up, where to click, etc.


Requires pyautogui, time 

Also, fair warning. Does not come with a kill switch. Use with extreme caution.

And with great power, yadda yadda yadda...
