[Verse 1]
I'm having a hard time trying to communicate
Standing in a line feeling like I can't relate
When I was a boy my heart was full of dreams
I'm no different now than I was yesterday

[Chorus]
On the outside looking in
I would have taken on the world back then
On the outside looking in
On the outside I never fit in

[Verse 2]
I miss the summer days that seem to last for years
We'd drink the night away 'til the sunrise was near
I wish I would have known all that I know now
I tried to change the world but I grew old somehow

[Chorus]
On the outside looking in
I would have taken on the world back then
On the outside looking in
On the outside I never fit in
On the outside looking in
I would have taken on the world back then
On the outside looking in
I was never cut quite to ever fit in

[Bridge]
Yeah, I know I don't act my age
I got old but I still feel the same
Prayed on a band, prayed on a van
I prayed for a way outta this place
I go back from time to time
I left back then and I know why
See, if I didn't, then I'd die
Some stayed and got old but my unstable heart shines like fucking gold

[Refrain]
On the outside looking in
On the outside never fit in
On the outside looking in
On the outside I never fit in
On the outside looking in
On the outside I never

[Chorus]
On the outside looking in
I would have taken on the world back then
On the outside looking in
On the outside I never fit in

[Outro]
On the outside
On the outside I never fit in
On the outside
On the outside I never fit in
